/**
 * \brief  vt100_scrollVD(int16_t scrollUp) - scroll up (+) or down (-) 1 Lines 
 *      Note: could scroll multiple lines if we saved the whole pointer arrays first
 *            Also - we could use the saved pointers to do a wrap around type buffer,
 *            but we can not use the saved pointers to restore previous text since 
 *            these are overwritten with blanks.  If we wanted to be able to "undo"
 *            a scroll up or down, we'd have to allocate text & attrib line buffers
 *            and save the line or lines that would be overwritten.
 * 
 *
 * \params[in]	int16_t    upDownFlag -  scroll up (+) or down(-): use 1 or -1
 *        
 * \param[out]	
 *               
 * \return		none
